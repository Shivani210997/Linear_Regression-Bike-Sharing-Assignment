# BoomBikes|Bike-Sharing-Assignment
Model the demand for shared bikes using the provided variables. This will help the management, understand how demand varies with different factors and adjust 
strategies accordingly. The model will also aid in analyzing demand dynamics in new markets.

## General Information
### General Information about the Project:
This project involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The goal is to help BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, understand the key factors influencing bike demand and to assist in formulating a strategic business plan post-pandemic for future growth.

### Project Background:
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has recently faced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The challenging market conditions 
have made it difficult for the company to maintain operations. To swiftly boost their revenue, once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers, BoomBikes is 
developing a strategic business plan.

### Business Goal:
The project aims to solve the problem of predicting the demand for shared bikes, enabling BoomBikes to anticipate customer needs and optimize their operations in a post-pandemic market. This understanding will help the company position itself competitively and increase revenue.

### Dataset that is being used:
The project uses a dataset collected from various meteorological surveys and consumer behavior studies. 
This dataset captures daily bike demand across the American market, along with factors influencing this demand, such as weather conditions and user demographics.
